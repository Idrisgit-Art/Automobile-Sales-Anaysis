# Simple Automobile Sales Data Analysis & Prediction

This project presents a basic analysis of automobile sales data and a simple machine learning model to predict future sales trends. It is ideal for beginners who are learning data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to explore historical automobile sales data, uncover trends, and use past sales information to predict future performance. The workflow involves:

* Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
* Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Visualizing key sales trends across time, region, and vehicle type.
* Building a simple regression model to predict sales volume.

## Project Structure

* **data/** – Contains the raw sales data file (e.g., CSV format).
* **notebooks/** – Includes the Jupyter notebook used for analysis and modeling.
* **model/** – Stores the trained machine learning model.
* **README.md** – This file, providing an overview of the project.
* **requirements.txt** – Lists Python libraries needed to run the project.

## Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, standardize column formats, and prepare data for analysis.
* **EDA & Visualization:** Use charts to understand seasonal trends, regional performance, and best selling vehicle types.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Apply a simple regression model (such as Linear Regression) to forecast future sales.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Use Cases

* Forecast future automobile sales for inventory planning.
* Identify best performing regions and product categories.
* Use as a learning resource for data science projects.

## How to Use

* Clone or download the repository.
* Install the required Python packages.
* Open the Jupyter notebook and follow through the analysis.
* Train and test the prediction model with the provided data.

## Notes

* The data used is either public or synthetic; it can be replaced with real world sales data for more accurate modeling.
* The project is focused on simplicity and learning, not production deployment.
* Can be extended with more complex models, interactive dashboards, or real time data pipelines.
